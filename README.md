# Marxist Internet Archive

A revisioning of the original [Marxist Internet Archive](https://www.marxists.org/). The vision was to recreate a New Yorker-ish, online-magazine type interface with interactive media, better indentation, and sleeker look. 

## Why?

I'm a huge fan of the newspaper/magazine style. I'm also initrigued by differing viewpoints and ways of looking at the world. So I decided to combine the two things I love into one with a tech stack I wasn't so versed in but willing to get better at. Thus, the New MIA was born. 

## Tech Used
-React.js
-Node.js
-Express.js
-Axios.js
-MongoDB

## Future Features
### - Migrate to a headless CMS for better content management
### - Implement Redux 
### - Add a real highlighting/annotation for users to write down their own thoughts
